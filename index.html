<!--  PART OF THE OLD SITE. UGLY AND NOT WANTED REALLY.	
	<div>
	<p>Here's a website of my friend <a href="http://www.allieq.com/">Allie Querengesser</a>. It's pretty good? I'm not a huge fan of the purple on purple, but lbr here, that's not an html issue. The honeycomb is neat, but that's clearly JavaScript. I'ma guess there was a WYSIWYG involved in making this because there's a lot of tags that seem not very her, but then again, there are some <code>&lt;br></code> (line break) tags hanging out which is, in my experience less common. Then again, I have <em>no</em> idea what I'm talking about. Viewing source interestingly enough doesn't actually take me to what I was expecting, but inspecting does. Lots of <code>&lt;div></code> elements with CSS tagging. There are some <code>&lt;style></code> elements, which I assume is like CSS without the cascading and the sheet. </p>
